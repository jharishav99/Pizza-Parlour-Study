# Pizza-Parlour-Study
Given the list of locations of customers who frequently order Pizza we want to find out optimal locations of Pizza Parlours where they should be opened.

K-Means Algorithm
Input Data : X = {x1,...,xN}

Goal : Partition the data among some K number of clusters. Let us assume K is known to us.

Let µk denote the center of Kth Cluster (uk will be vector)

So we need to ﬁnd an assignment of data points to clusters, as well as a set of cluster centers{µk}, such that the sum of the squares of the distances of each data point to its closest cluster center µk, is a minimum.
